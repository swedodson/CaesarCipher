# CaesarCipher
# Clay Dodson

#This program takes a user input with letters, numbers, or special characters and encrypts the letters in the text. It's called the Caesar cipher as Julius Caesar would #use a similar method to encrypt the messages he sent to Rome during his conquest of Gaul. The program imitates Caesar's encryption method by looping through each letter #in the message and shifting that letter's position in the alphabet by the amount chosen by the user. The program then outputs the new text that has the letters shifted #by the shift amount the user chose. 

#The user can also decrypt messages that have already been encrypted by inputting the encrypted message and the shift amount. The user can also chose whether or not to #continue encrypting/decrypting messages. If they choose to continue, a while loop will prompt the user for their choice of "encode" or "decode" again. If they choose #not to continue, it will exit the program.
